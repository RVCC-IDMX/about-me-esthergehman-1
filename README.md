## Project Description
I learned the basics of HTML and CSS by creating this project in my Web Development college course. I learned about importing fonts, embedding media, the purpose of different file types such as jpg, png, and svg, and how to style your HTML using CSS. One of the most interesting aspects was learning about media queries, which allowed me to make my website responsive and look good on both mobile and desktop devices.
