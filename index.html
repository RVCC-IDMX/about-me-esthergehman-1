                <p>
                    My name is Esther Gehman, I'm 21, and I'm a college student at Raritan Valley Community College. I live along the Delaware River in New Jersey, and it's the perfect place for nature lovers! I have a bernedoodle named Juniper, and I enjoy walking along the river with her. I love travelling. My favorite place I've ever been to is Norway! My favorite number is 17. I'm vegetarian, and I love to try new cuisines. My favorite foods and drinks are sushi, smoothies, coffee, chocolate, and pizza.

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time, my favorite activity is playing guitar. I've been playing guitar for about three years. I have an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar but I definitely prefer to play acoustic! I grew up around music, I started playing the violin in Kindergarten, then I switched to the cello in third grade, and then when I moved to New Jersey in sixth grade I pretty much stopped playing. In my senior year of high school I picked up the guitar and I haven't put it down since! In the winter I love to go skiing, but I also love to stay inside and crochet hats. I ran cross country and track in high school, so to stay active I love going on hikes and runs. If it's a rainy day and I'm stuck inside, you may find me playing Stardew Valley or Minecraft.

            <h3>Lyrics of one of my favorite songs:</h3>

            <h4>Country by Racoma</h4>

            <p>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                Won't you hang round here<br>
                Just like like you do<br>
                Like you've always done<br>
                Go on and let the light in<br>
                It's easier weather now<br>
                It's easier weather now<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                [Verse 2]<br>
                Moonlit country breeze<br>
                Oh remember that night<br>
                When I kissed you on the cheek<br>
                You said it wasn't the same any more<br>
                Thought I felt some pain before<br>
                Come on and let me in<br>
                Let's go on and start again<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                [Chorus]<br>
                We can work it out<br>
                If you're around<br>
                Like you were last year<br>
                We can work it out<br>
                Just be around<br>

            <h2>Background-image Property</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    In CSS, background-image is used to place images as the background of a chosen HTML element. There are a few properties such as repeat, size, 
                    position, origin, and clip that can be used to change the default properties of the background image. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    By default, when you use background-image, the image repeats itself both horizontally and vertically to fill the background of the chosen element. 
                    To change this, you can use background-repeat. Options include repeat, no-repeat, space, and round. Repeat is default, no-repeat will display the 
                    image once, space will repeat the image with even whitespace between the images, and round will repeat the image and as the size of the element increases, 
                    the images will stretch out until there’s enough room to fit another copy of the image and then the copies of the image repeated already will snap back 
                    to a smaller size to fit the new copy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Background-size is a CSS property used to change the size of the background image. Contain is a value you can use to make the image as large 
                    as possible without stretching or cropping the image. Cover is a value you can use to fill the background of the element with the image and it 
                    will leave no empty space. If you use cover and the image has different dimensions, the image will be cropped. With this size property you can 
                    specify width and height dimensions or use auto. Any space that isn’t covered by the image will be the color set in the background-color property. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Background-position is a CSS property used to set the position of the background image. Default positioning is in the top left corner of the 
                    element. This property accepts up to four values. Center is a value you can use for centering the image on either axis or both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Background-origin is a CSS property used to set the origin of the image. Options are border-box, padding-box, and content-box. Padding-box 
                    is the default value of this property. Content-box will set the image to start at the top left corner of the content within the element. 
                    Border-box will set the image to start at the top left corner where the border starts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Background-clip is a CSS property used to choose whether or not the background goes underneath the border. Options for values include 
                    border-box, padding-box, and content-box. Border-box allows the background to extend to the outside edge of the border. Padding-box 
                    allows the background to extend to the outside edge of the padding, and if there is a border, the background will not display behind it. 
                    Content-box will make the background stay contained in the content box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are a few possible concerns when it comes to using an image background. For example, when someone uses a screen reader to 
                    access your website, the screen reader won’t be able to convey to the user that a background image is used. 
                    </p>
