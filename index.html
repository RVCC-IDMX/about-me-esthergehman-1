            <h3>Lyrics of one of my favorite songs:</h3>

            <h4>Country by Racoma</h4>

            <p>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                Won't you hang round here<br>
                Just like like you do<br>
                Like you've always done<br>
                Go on and let the light in<br>
                It's easier weather now<br>
                It's easier weather now<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                [Verse 2]<br>
                Moonlit country breeze<br>
                Oh remember that night<br>
                When I kissed you on the cheek<br>
                You said it wasn't the same any more<br>
                Thought I felt some pain before<br>
                Come on and let me in<br>
                Let's go on and start again<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                [Chorus]<br>
                We can work it out<br>
                If you're around<br>
                Like you were last year<br>
                We can work it out<br>
                Just be around<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Excerpt from Pride and Prejudice</h2>

            <div>
                <p>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought
                    there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper
                    to be happy; and all was soon right again.</p>

                <p>With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the
                    word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county
                    with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”</p>

                <p>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's
                    arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length
                    appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were
                    to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose
                    steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
                    way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</p>

                <p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in
                    pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions; a
                    suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance
                    every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
                    disappointments abroad.</p>

                <p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable
                    places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham,
                    etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little
                    town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned
                    some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders
                    of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was
                    situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over
                    their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr.
                    Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.</p>

                <p>“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?” said her aunt; “a
                    place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth
                    there, you know.”</p>
